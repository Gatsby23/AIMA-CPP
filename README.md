AIMA-CPP
========

C++(1y) implementation of algorithms from Norvig And Russell's "Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach 3rd Edition."

# typename COPYRIGHT = MIT

I really want others to contribute over this ( at least the examples are so few ) :)
It would be great if someone try to to solve the questions in the book by this little library.

#TODO

## I'd like to write a little GUI (with Qt) to show how these algorithms work.
## Trying to compile everything on windows with VC++; I used almost no feature of c++1y so it's possible to port this to windows.

Currently I'm just implementing step by step while I read the book :)
Let's hope I'll do the rest or someone else would do it.

# Examples

Take a look at Test.hpp and Test.cpp for now.
There will be a separated directory for examples
